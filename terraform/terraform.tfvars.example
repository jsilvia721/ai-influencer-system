# Terraform Variables for AI Training Infrastructure
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values

# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"  # Change to your preferred region

# Project Configuration
project_name = "ai-influencer-training"

# Instance Configuration
instance_type = "g4dn.xlarge"    # Options: g4dn.xlarge, g4dn.2xlarge, p3.2xlarge
max_spot_price = "0.50"          # Maximum price you're willing to pay per hour

# Training Configuration
training_duration_hours = 4      # Expected training time

# Security Configuration
key_pair_name = "your-key-pair-name"     # REQUIRED: Your AWS EC2 Key Pair name
allowed_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]      # Restrict to your IP for better security

# Instance Type Recommendations:
# - g4dn.xlarge:  ~$0.20-0.40/hr spot, 16GB GPU RAM, Good for most LoRA training
# - g4dn.2xlarge: ~$0.40-0.80/hr spot, 16GB GPU RAM, Faster training
# - p3.2xlarge:   ~$0.60-1.20/hr spot, 16GB GPU RAM, High performance
# 
# Cost Optimization Tips:
# - Use us-east-1 region for cheapest spot prices
# - Set max_spot_price to 70% of on-demand price
# - Monitor spot price history in AWS console
