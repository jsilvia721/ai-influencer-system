# Mock API Configuration
# Set to 'true' to enable mock API for training image generation (no API costs)
# Set to 'false' or remove to use real Replicate API
REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API=false

# When REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API=true:
# - Training image generation will be simulated
# - No actual API calls to Replicate
# - Progress tracking and retry logic will be demonstrated
# - Success rates and failure scenarios will be simulated realistically

# For testing the retry mechanism without API costs:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Set REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API=true
# 3. Restart the development server
# 4. Test the training image generation feature

# Note: Character management and LoRA training still use real APIs
# Only the training image generation uses mock mode
